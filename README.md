# boolean-search-bib-abstract
Logical search on title and abstract of a *.bib* file

Tested with [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/) bib file with abstracts.

## Improvement plan
- Searching through all bib items is time-consuming, which can be shortened by reducing bib items with manual filterings, such as year
- The publication year should also be included in the resultant file
